# 📈 Sales Performance & Profitability Analysis

## 🎯 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to move beyond basic data visualization to perform a deep-dive **Profitability Analysis**. I focused on identifying which product categories drive volume versus which drive margins, while also mapping out customer payment preferences and regional performance.

## 💡 Key Business Insights
Based on the data captured in the dashboard:

* **Category Dominance:** While the inventory is diverse, **Clothing accounts for 63% of all quantities sold**, making it the primary volume driver.
* **High-Value Profit Centers:** Despite lower volume compared to clothing, **Printers and Phones** emerged as the top-tier profit generators among sub-categories.
* **Payment Behavior:** A significant **44% of customers prefer Cash on Delivery (COD)**, which is more than double the usage of UPI (18%) or Credit Cards (11%).
* **Geographic Leader:** **Maharashtra** is the top-performing state by sales amount, followed by Madhya Pradesh and Delhi.
* **Top Contributor:** **Harivansh** was identified as the most profitable individual customer, highlighting a concentration of value in specific high-spend accounts.
